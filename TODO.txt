TODO

* Remove the __init__thing and just load anything in the app folder.  

* Emptying infolder when something is not moved from there by the handlers. (Sort of a final sweep - take everything thats left and put in an 'unsolved' box.) The folder should be empty, so this should trigger a warning.

* mpeg-test remains

* make handling of next available name more consistent

* Cleanup the general mess in method_video.move_me

* gem isolation (check the book and example files to figure out how it should work)

* Use Mail.app for email notification.
